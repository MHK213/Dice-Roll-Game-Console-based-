## Title : Dice Roll Game

---

## Description :
The Dice Roll Game project is a small project I developed during my journey to learn the basics of programming in C++. The game is as follows:
- The number of rounds is chosen by the player.
- The player rolls the dice (the roll is done by displaying a random number from one to six based on RandomNumber function (the same applies to the computer).
- The player who rolls the highest number wins the round.
- The score of the player, the computer, and the winner of the round is printed. (If the player wins, the screen turns green. If they lose, the screen turns red with a bell sound.)
- At the end of the game, the number of rounds for the player, the computer, and the final winner are printed.
- The following concepts were applied: Enums, Struct, random number generation, loops and conditions.
- Use functions to keep code clean.

Built using C++ (Without relying on ÙŽAI), and Visual Studio.
